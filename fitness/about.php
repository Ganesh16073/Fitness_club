					<h3> FITNESS CLUB</h3>
					<p>The Fitness Club is a health, recreational, and social facility geared towards exercise, sports, and other physical activities. It may be a for-profit commercial facility or a community- or institutionally-supported center. A successful facility will accommodate both the serious athlete and the casual recreational user.

						Activities include organized, group instructional programs such as spinning classes, yoga, and martial arts; organized and impromptu team sports; and individual fitness opportunities such as cardiovascular training, weight training, and swimming. Individual activities may be self-guided or conducted under the supervision of a trainer. A Fitness Center may also accommodate outdoor activities with features such as a running track, swimming pool and sport playing fields.
						
						The social component is an important secondary function of the Fitness Center and is represented by elements that support the fitness goals but also encourage social interaction. These include a juice or snack bar, sport spectator seating, saunas, and hot tubs.</p>
